</p><h1>ICFP 2002 Programming Contest Challenge Task</h1>
<h2>Document Version 3</h2>

This document describes the ICFP 2002 Programming Contest Challenge
Task.  Its home is at
<code>http://icfpcontest.cse.ogi.edu/task.html</code>
<p>
The challenge is to implement a program that acts as a player in a
multi-player robot game.  Contributed programs will play against each
other in a tournament, which will determine the winner of the
programming contest.

</p><p>
In the game, simulated robots deliver packages in a simulated world.
Each player controls one robot.  The simulation proceeds in discrete
steps. At every step, each robot executes one command, which may move
the robot, pick up packages or drop packages.  Robots win points for
successfully delivering packages to their destination.  The winner of
a game is the robot who finishes the game with the most points (but
see the tournament rules later).

<h2 id="world">The world</h2>

The world is a rectangular area of square tiles. 
Each tile is either open space, a wall, water or a home base. 
Robots can walk in open space and on home bases. 
Walls are impassable. 
If a robot steps on water, it drowns.  
The edges of the world behave as if there were walls beyond them.

<p>
Home bases are where packages are initially located. All robots compete
for the same set of packages.

</p><p>
Coordinates on the board are pairs of integers, ranging from (1,1) to
(<var>width</var>, <var>height</var>), where (1,1) is the southwest
corner of the board.

</p><h2 id="robots">The robots</h2>

A robot has a unique identifier (a positive integer), a maximum carrying capacity, and a sum of
money for bidding.

<p>
The player controls the robot by issuing commands.

</p><ul>
  <li>The <code>Move</code> command moves the robot to an adjacent square,
      in one of the four directions north, east, south or west.
  </li><li>The <code>Pick</code> command is used to pick packages.  Packages
      are initially available from home bases.
      Packages may not be picked up if they are too heavy, or if there are no
      packages available.
  </li><li>The <code>Drop</code> command is used to drop packages.
      Packages are always dropped. 
</li></ul>

In each step of the game each robot executes one command. The order in
which these commands is executed is important, as robots can <em>push</em>
each other.

<h3 id="pushing">Pushing and Bidding </h3>

<p>
Robots may push each other.  Robot <code>1</code> is said to push
robot <code>2</code> if <code>1</code> tries to move onto <code>2</code>'s
location.  Typically that will result in <code>2</code> moving to the
adjacent square in the direction it was pushed.  If this happens
to be a lethal square <code>2</code> will die.  If it happens to be
a wall neither robot will move, but <code>2</code> is still considered
to be pushed.  Pushing is transitive in the sense that if
<code>1</code> pushes <code>2</code>, that may result in <code>2</code>
pushing <code>3</code>.  Both <code>2</code> and <code>3</code> are
considered to have been pushed, and (again) the robots will only move
if all of them can move.

</p><p>
When a robot is pushed it gets rebooted. While rebooting no command
can be executed. A reboot lasts until the end of the current turn.
As a result if a robot gets pushed before executing its command, the
robot will not execute its command.
</p>

<p>
When a robot is pushed it drops a random package if it has at least one and
then is moved to its new location (if possible).
</p>

<p>
<u>Example</u>: Assume there are robots <code>1,2,3</code> located as in 
the <em>Before</em> column below. <code>1</code> wants to move
east and <code>2</code> wants to move north. <code>3</code> will
not move in the scenarios.
The table illustrates different scenarios. <tt>#</tt> is a wall, <tt>.</tt>
is empty space (see the <a href="#transmittingboard">transmitting the board</a>)
</p><center>
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">

<p>
<em>Bids</em> are used to control the order of moves. Every command
has a bid, and the commands are executed in order of decreasing bids.
Commands with the same bid are executed in a random order.
</p>

<p>Bids may be positive or negative, but not 0.  Positive bids increase
the chance of a robot executing its command <em>before</em> other robots,
while a negative bid increases the chance of its command being executed 
<em>after</em> other robots.  Both of those are useful in certain situations.
The cost of a bid is its absolute value.  For example bidding -50 will still
decrease the robot's balance by 50 units of money.

</p><p>
If a robot did not execute its command because it was rebooting
the bid still is deducted from its money.
</p>

<p>Bidding more than the robot's budget results in its death.
For every command a robot must spend at least 1 unit of money.
</p>

<p><u>Example</u>: If a robot starts with 1000 units of money,
and its policy is to spend 1 unit per command, it can participate
in at most 1000 turns of the game, as on the 1001st first move it will
over-spend and die.
</p>

<p>
A robot that dies disappear from the game.
</p>

<h2 id="packages">The packages</h2>
Every package has a unique identifier (a non-negative integer), a weight and a destination.
If a robot dies, its packages disappear.  Packages disappear when they
are delivered to their destination.  If a package is dropped at a location
different from its destination, it just stays there until someone picks it up.



<h1 id="gameprotocol">The game protocol</h1>

The protocol works in text mode, using ASCII characters.  
The server and clients send each other lines of text.  
We use the UNIX convention of what a line is, i.e. a line is terminated
by a single new line character <code>'\n'</code>(ASCII code 10).

Integers are also sent as
text, for example the number 1765 is sent as 4 consecutive characters:
'1', '7', '6', '5'.

<p>The clients and server communicate with each other via TCP/IP sockets.
The host name where the server is located and the port number on which
it is listening for connections will be provided as the first two
command line arguments of a client.
</p>


<p>The game proceeds in two phases: an initialization phase, and the
actual game play. 
</p>

<h2 id="initialization">Initialization</h2>

The initialization phase occurs as soon as a client joins a game.
The protocol is as follows:

  <ol>
  <li>Client: send the line <tt>Player</tt>
  </li><li>Server: send board
  </li><li>Server: send player's configuration
  </li><li>Server: send initial server response (with the initial location of all players)
  </li></ol>

<h3 id="transmittingboard">Transmitting the board</h3>

The board is transmitted in the following format:

  <ol>
  <li>Server: board dimensions
  </li><li>Server: board row 1 ...
  </li><li>Server: ... other rows ...
  </li><li>Server: board row <i>n</i> 
  </li></ol>

<p>The dimensions are two integers, the first one indicating the width
(i.e. the number of columns), and the second one the height 
(i.e. the number of rows) on the board.
</p>

<p>Once the dimensions are transmitted, the server sends one line
for every row of the board.  The first line corresponds to the row
with vertical coordinate 1, i.e. the board is sent from south to north.
</p>

<p>Every row consists of a number of characters, indicating the type
of tile at the corresponding position in the row.  The first character
corresponds to horizontal position 1, i.e. each row is sent from west to east.

This is the encoding for the different tile types:
  <table border="1">
  <tbody><tr><td>plain</td><td><tt>.</tt> (a dot)
  </td></tr><tr><td>lethal (water)</td><td><tt>~</tt> (a tilde)
  </td></tr><tr><td>impassable (wall)</td><td><tt>#</tt> (a hash)
  </td></tr><tr><td>home base</td><td><tt>@</tt> (an at)
  </td></tr></tbody></table>

</p><p><u>Example</u>: Here is a (very small) example board:

</p><pre>7 5
..@....
.......
##.~~~~
...~~~~
.......
</pre>

This map has a home base (<tt>@</tt>) at position (3,1).
Note that since row 1 is transmitted first, the north direction
of the board is down.

<h3 id="transmittingconfiguration">Transmitting the configuration</h3>

The configuration consists of
<ul>
  <li>a unique identifier,
  </li><li>the maximum carrying capacity,
  </li><li>the initial amount of money (used for bidding)
</li></ul>

These are all integers and are sent on one line, separated by spaces, in the
above order.

<p><u>Example</u>: Here is an example of the initialization information
send by the server to a client who happens to be controlling
robot 3, who can carry at most 25 units of weight, and starts with 1000
units of money at location (1,1).  In this particular game there
was also robot 2 at location (2,1) and a robot 1 at location (1,2).

</p><pre>7 5
..@....
.......
##.~~~~
...~~~~
.......
3 25 1000
#2 X 2 Y 1 #1 X 1 Y 2 #3 X 1 Y 1
</pre>

<p>
Note that the position of the players are transmitted in
standard server response line, described below.


</p><h2 id="gameplay">Game play</h2>

The game is made up of a number of turns.  A turn looks as follows:

  <ol>
  <li>Server: a list of packages available at the player's current location
  </li><li>Client: issue a command to the robot
  </li><li>Server: server responds with what happened during the turn
  </li></ol>

At the beginning of each round the server sends 
a list of all the packages (if any) available at the player's position.
The client is then expected to respond with a command for its
robot to execute. The server then says what happened to all robots
during the turn.

<h3 id="transmittingpackages">Transmitting the list of packages</h3>

For every available package the server will send 4 integers:
the package ID, the horizontal position of its destination,
the vertical position of its destination, and the package weight.
  
<p><u>Example</u>: If there are 2 packages, package 17 to be delivered
to position (133,28) weighing 50 units, and package 89 to be delivered
to position (11,57) weighing 78 units, the server will send the following line:
</p><p align="center"><tt>17 133 28 50 89 11 57 78</tt>
</p><p>
Note, that if there are no packages at a location the server will send
just a blank line.

</p><h3 id="commands">Commands for the robots</h3>

A command to a robot consists of two parts: the bid and the action.
The bid is an integer, the action is one of:
  <ul>
  <li><tt>Move</tt> <i>direction</i>
  </li><li><tt>Pick</tt> <i>list of package IDs</i>
  </li><li><tt>Drop</tt> <i>list of package IDs</i>
  </li></ul>

  <ul>
  <li>A direction is one of: <tt>N E S W</tt>
  </li><li>A package ID is an integer
  </li><li>A list of package IDs consists of integers separated by space
  </li></ul>

<p><u>Example</u>: Here are some example commands:
<br><tt>1 Move N</tt>
<br><tt>200 Pick 17 89</tt>
<br><tt>29 Move W</tt>
<br><tt>-8 Move S</tt>
<br><tt>57 Drop 11</tt>
<br><tt>1 Drop</tt>
</p>

The package_id list to <tt>Pick</tt> and <tt>Drop</tt> can be empty.
It is also OK to pick packages which are not there
and drop packages which you are not carrying. 
In both cases the packages that are valid will be dropped or picked.
<p>
Any malformed command will kill the robot.
</p>

<h3 id="reply">Server's reply to commands</h3>

At the end of each turn the server will send each
player a reply showing what happened to all robots during the turn.
All the players will receive the same information.

<p>
The format of the response is list of robot updates. Each robot update
is of the form <tt>#</tt><var>robot_id</var> and then the actions in the order
they happened. A robot is listed if and only if it was alive at the beginning
of the turn.
The following actions are possible:
</p><ul>
<li><tt>N</tt> The robot moved north.
</li><li><tt>S</tt> The robot moved south.
</li><li><tt>E</tt> The robot moved east.
</li><li><tt>W</tt> The robot moved west.
</li><li><tt>P</tt> <var>id</var> The robot picked up package with id <var>id</var>.
</li><li><tt>D</tt> <var>id</var> The robot dropped package with id <var>id</var>.
</li><li><tt>X</tt> <var>num1</var> <tt>Y</tt> <var>num2</var> The robots
location is set to <var>(num1,num2)</var>.
</li></ul>

<p>
<u>Example</u>:
<table border="1">
<tbody><tr><td><tt>#2 E #3 #1 N</tt></td><td>Robot 2 moved east, robot 1
moved north, and robot 3 did not move at all.
</td></tr><tr><td><tt>#1 W #2 P 0 P 1</tt></td><td> Robot 2 picked up package 0 and 1 and robot 1 moved west.
</td></tr><tr><td><tt>#2 E #1 W E</tt></td><td> Robot 2 moved east and robot 1 moved west and then east (i.e. robot 1 was pushed).
</td></tr><tr><td><tt>#1 X 1 Y 1 E #2 E</tt></td><td> Robot 2 moved east and robot 1 appeared at location (1,1) and moved east.
</td></tr></tbody></table>


</p><h3 id="endofgame">The end of the game</h3>
The game ends either when all packages have been delivered or all
robots are dead.

<h1 id="scoring">Scoring</h1>
A correctly delivered package scores the player an amount equal to
the weight of the package.

Each robot will participate in a number of games. 
In each game all the robots will be given the same carrying capacity
and the same amount of money.  The winner of a
game is the robot who has the highest score at the end of the game.
The winner of the competition is the player with the highest total
score over all games.

<p>

</p><p>
Some games will have a single robot others will have multiple robots.
Robots should strive to get the highest score, irregardless of the presence
of other robots.
The sizes of the maps may vary between 1x1 and 1000x1000 squares.
Here are <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/%7Esheard/2002IcfpContest/maps.html">some sample maps</a>.  The number of packages
will vary between 1 and 10,000.  The maximum amount of money robots might
be given is 1,000,000,000. The weight of a package will be between 1 and
1,000,000,000. The maximum carrying capacity a robot might be given is
1,000,000,000.
</p>

<p>Throughout the competition participants are encouraged to submit maps
to the judges.   Judges could be impressed by interesting maps...
Mail them to 
<a href="mailto:icfp-judges@cse.ogi.edu?subject=My%20maps">icfp-judges@cse.ogi.edu</a>
with the words <em>My maps</em> in the subject line.
